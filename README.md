## Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This project contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms, developed from scratch without relying on libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of these algorithms by exploring their inner workings.


This repository features the following algorithms:

* Linear Regression

* Logistic Regression

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* K-Means Clustering

* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
